Hello everyone, we've released another minor update!

## What’s New

* We've added a Bluetooth Low-Energy plugin to the Developer App. The plugin fully supports iOS and Android, and will gracefully trigger the failure callback on Windows Phone. You can [learn how to use the BLE plugin][1] on the official GitHub repository.

* Bumped `phonegap-plugin-contentsync@1.1.5` to help with connection timeout issues on iOS.


## Upcoming Release

In our next release you can expect:

* Better connection and autoreload speeds from `connect-phonegap`.

* Small fixes to make the three/four finger tap better.

Thanks for using our app!
