We're so excited to announce the launch of the PhoneGap Community on Adobe Forums.

With one easy login, we're looking forward to providing a one-stop shop and seamless experience for your PhoneGap support needs.

All PhoneGap users and partners are invited to become members of the PhoneGap Community on Adobe Forums. Help grow the forum by posting your questions, thoughts and ideas. Now's your chance to be the first to contribute to the forum to help steer its direction and add value for fellow PhoneGap users.

The PhoneGap community has been such a huge part of who we are and what we do! We want to keep it that way as we push PhoneGap into the future so get involved and share your knowledge. This is such a great opportunity to connect and collaborate with members of the PhoneGap and Cordova teams, and more importantly, thousands of PhoneGap developers who have been where you are and have tons of tips and tricks to share.

**Sign up to become a PhoneGap Community member today!**
