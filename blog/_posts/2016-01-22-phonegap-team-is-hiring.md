We're looking for a Product Manager to join the Adobe PhoneGap team! 

#PhoneGap Product Manager#

The Adobe PhoneGap team is looking for an experienced Product Manager to help guide us in building the best mobile tools for enabling developers to build amazing apps. Do you relish the opportunity to make the working lives of mobile developers and their products better? Do you work well not only with your team but across a larger organization and the mobile developer community? Are you passionate about the mobile web and drive product decisions from your strong vision tempered with cold hard data? It’s also important that you can work closely with engineers and preferably have a technical background writing code in your spare time.
 
If that’s you then what are we waiting for? Let’s do this.
 
What you’ll do:

- Use a combination of product instinct, data, and teamwork to ensure we ship well-crafted product at a timely pace.
- Write specs and user stories, create wireframes, prototypes, test plans, release checklists. Communicate functionality and incorporate feedback. Rinse and repeat.
- Create and prioritize your team’s roadmap and milestones. Work with your team to estimate, implement, and build just the right features.
- Develop relationships with developers, partners and cross functional teams to extend the reach of the PhoneGap tools.

Sound like you or someone you know? Apply or help spread the word. We're a pretty cool team to work with, promise :)
