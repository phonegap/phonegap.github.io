<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US 2016 in Lehi, UT. We'll be posting more videos from the conference (and the workshops!) so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>It was awesome to have Nick Van Weerdenburg, CEO of <a href"http://rangle.io/">Rangle.io</a>, at PhoneGap Day this year. He talks about "Fixing Continuous Delivery for Mobile". Manual builds and app store approval lags make it near impossible to have an effective mobile continuous delivery process. In turn, this hurts our attempts to be truly Agile with our mobile projects. The solution? Per-pull request deployment through CircleCI, CodePush and a custom CodePush loader in your app. This enables hands-free, automated deployment from commit to a user device, radically changing your testing, validation, and your user feedback processes.</p>

<p>Nick, CEO of <a href"http://rangle.io/">Rangle.io</a>, was also able to interview the speakers from PhoneGap Day. Check out what they had to say about the mobile ecosystem <a href"http://blog.rangle.io/the-mobile-ecosystem-in-2016-and-what-you-need-to-know/">here</a>.</p>
