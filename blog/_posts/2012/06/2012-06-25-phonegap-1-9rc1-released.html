<p>We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/1.9.0rc1">PhoneGap 1.9.0</a>!  This version of PhoneGap is composed mainly of bug fixes and the addition of Cordova webview for Android. </p>

<p>Cordova webview (Cleaver on iOS) allows integration of phonegap, as a view fragment, into a bigger native application.</p>

<p>For those of you wanting to be a step ahead, download and run 1.9.0rc1 on your machines. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB">issue tracker</a>. Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.  </p>

<p>We'll continue to provide our latest release, PhoneGap 1.8.1, as the main download in our top nav and stay tuned for the official 1.9.0 release in the coming days!</p>

<p><strong>Looking for older versions of PhoneGap?</strong>
Download PhoneGap 1.8.0 and earlier from <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/tags">Github</a>.</p>
