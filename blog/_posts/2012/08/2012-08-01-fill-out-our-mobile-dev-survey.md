We're studying the everyday work processes and tool choices of mobile developers and want to hear from you! We're interested in a wide range of perspectives, from experienced PhoneGap developers to people who haven't tried PhoneGap yet. All programming languages and levels of expertise are welcome. 

How to Participate
------------------
We're working with Adobe Research for the [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PhoneGap2012). Participants will be contacted by a researcher to arrange a phone or face-to-face conversation. As a thank you, we'll be offering participants an Amazon gift card and/or Adobe software.
