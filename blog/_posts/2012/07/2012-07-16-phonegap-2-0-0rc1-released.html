<p>We have just released the first release candidate (RC) for <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/zipball/2.0.0rc1">PhoneGap 2.0.0</a>. We're really excited about this major milestone for the PhoneGap project! A changelog can be found within the download.</p>

<p>For those of you wanting to be a step ahead, download and run 2.0.0rc1 on your machines. If you find any bugs with this version, help out the community and project by reporting them on our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB">issue tracker</a>. Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.  </p>

<p>We'll continue to provide our latest release, PhoneGap 1.9.0, as the main download in our top nav and stay tuned for the official 2.0.0 release on Friday on <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2012/">PhoneGap Day</a>! (There are still <a href="http://phonegapdaypdx.eventbrite.com/">tickets</a> available if you want to join us).</p>
