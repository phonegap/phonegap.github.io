<p>PhoneGap and Kinvey, Inc., the leading Backend as a Service company that makes it easy for developers to setup and operate scalable cloud backends for mobile, tablet and web apps, today announce an “end-to-end” technical integration between the PhoneGap environment and Kinvey’s Backend as a Service.  With this new solution, developers using PhoneGap to build mobile applications can now save themselves the time and aggravation of building the backend "plumbing" that every data-driven application requires. Kinvey offers developers a full-featured, scalable cloud backend, out of the box and ready to grow through every stage of the development life cycle - from prototype to worldwide adoption or “chart-topper”.</p>

<p>To use the integrated solution, a PhoneGap developer simply downloads the Kinvey JavaScript library for PhoneGap, drops it into their app, and focuses on the frontend, creative aspects of development.  The backend is ready to go from Day 1, so a developer can use at will the Kinvey backend features like: data collections, user management, geoqueries, analytics, versioned APIs, external data integration (beta) and business logic (beta).</p>

<p>PhoneGap's Dave Johnson says "Kinvey is a great option if you are looking for a backend solution to use with PhoneGap."</p>

<p>“Developers love PhoneGap because they can use their existing web skills to build apps for any mobile platform,” said Sravish Sridhar, CEO and Founder of Kinvey, Inc.  “Together we extend the reach of those existing web skills even further – putting Kinvey’s power of data and cloud services in the developers’ hands, directly from the PhoneGap environment.”</p>
