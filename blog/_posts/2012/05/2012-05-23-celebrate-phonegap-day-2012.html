<p>Last year, we hosted our first ever PhoneGap Day in Portland, Oregon and we're excited to announce that we're doing it again! On Friday, July 20th, we're hosting our second PhoneGap Day at <a href="http://leftbankannex.com/">The LeftBank Annex</a> in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>PhoneGap Day is one part conference and one part celebration where you'll meet and mingle with other people who use PhoneGap as part of their mobile app development. We'll have tons of speakers covering the latest on PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build, tools, apps, and more. You'll get to meet the PhoneGap team and connect with other PhoneGap developers from IBM, Facebook, and many more. </p>

<p>And of course, what's a PhoneGap event without some beer? We'll be serving a catered breakfast and lunch with plenty of beer to go around. </p>
