<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. We're sharing videos from the event for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/coldfumonkeh">Matt Gifford's</a> talk "Automating PhoneGap Build" explores the PhoneGap Build API to show how it can be used to enhance the developer's workflow and how it can be tied into tools such as ANT for instant management of code. Learn how to build your apps through PhoneGap Build with a few simple clicks using the API. Don't miss the Q&amp;A session around the 17:40-min mark.</p>
