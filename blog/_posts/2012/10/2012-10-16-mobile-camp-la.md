An amazing crew in Los Angeles have got together and organized [Mobile Camp LA](http://mobilecampla.com/) for October 18th, 2012. Among these extraordinary people are [PhoneGap LA Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/laphonegap/) organizers [George McKinney](https://twitter.com/georgemck/) and [Josue Bustos](https://twitter.com/hozwe).

PhoneGap will be well represented at Mobile Camp LA. [Gord Tanner](https://twitter.com/gordtanner) and [Michael Brooks](https://twitter.com/mwbrooks) are core contributors to the [Apache Cordova](incubator.apache.org/cordova) project, which is the engine that powers PhoneGap. There will also be passionate developers such as [Greg Wilson](https://twitter.com/gregsramblings), [Max Katz](https://twitter.com/maxkatz), [Chris Griffith](https://twitter.com/ChrisGriffith), and [Audrey Roy](https://twitter.com/audreyr) in attendance to share their knowledge of mobile application development and PhoneGap.

Outside of the presentation rooms, PhoneGap and BlackBerry have teamed up to help you add BlackBerry 10 support to your existing PhoneGap application. The first ten (10) people to successfully port their application to BlackBerry 10 will be given a BlackBerry 10 device! You can read the full details at [Calling All PhoneGap Devs to Mobile Camp LA](http://devblog.blackberry.com/2012/10/calling-all-phonegap-devs-to-mobile-camp-la/).
