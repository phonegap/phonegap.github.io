<p>Thank you to everyone who attended <a href="http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2012/">PhoneGap Day EU</a> and made it such a huge success. Here's the next highlight video for those of you who weren't able to attend.</p>

<p>Our very own <a href="http://twitter.com/davejohnson">Dave Johnson</a> discusses what's new in PhoneGap 2.0, which was released July 20, 2012. He touches on a variety of topics including the move into the Apache Software Foundation, documentation, new platforms, embedded webview, plugins, and CLI. There's also a bonus Q&amp;A period after Dave's talk (kicking in at around the 9-min mark) including questions about native sound, large databases, plugin information, Weinre and Windows Phone, and more.</p>
