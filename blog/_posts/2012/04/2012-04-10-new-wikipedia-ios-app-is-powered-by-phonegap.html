<p><strong>Update Apr 25:</strong> They've now ported it over to BlackBerry Playbook too! Check it out <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/105171/?lang=en">here</a>.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Wikimedia on their Wikipedia app for iOS.  We're really excited as this new app is based on the same code as their Wikipedia Android app -- both are powered by PhoneGap!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.wikimedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/image00.png" alt="" />Since they used PhoneGap, they were able to leverage their existing code to quickly and easily port it over to iOS. The new version of the Wikipedia app for iOS has all the features from their Android app, but styled to be consistent with iOS. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Search suggestions</p></li>
<li><p>Full text search</p></li>
<li><p>“Did you mean?” results</p></li>
<li><p>Saving pages for offline viewing</p></li>
<li><p>Share pages via Twitter, Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Save pages to Read It Later</p></li>
<li><p>Read current page in other languages</p></li>
<li><p>Map integration to view nearby articles</p></li>
<li><p>View location of current article + nearby articles in a map</p></li>
<li><p>Set the default language</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation history features</p></li>
<li><p>… and some more!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Wikimedia Foundation has seen great success when they launched their official Android app at the end of January. According to their <a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/04/05/new-wikipedia-app-for-ios-and-an-update-for-our-android-app/">blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve had ~2.25 million installations and ~5000 ratings (with a 4.4/5.0 average). Preliminary reports also indicate about 23 million page views per month via the app. In short, it has been doing pretty well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We look forward to seeing their new iOS app achieve the same great results as their Android app!</p>
