<p>We have just released <a href="http://phonegap.com/download">PhoneGap 1.6.1</a>! The PhoneGap/Apache Cordova Community has worked hard to fix some bugs that arose from the 1.6.0 release that needed to be addressed immediately.</p>

<p>The main issue driving this quick release was the incorrect xml folder that was included with the Android code that caused the network API to fail. This was a bug that needed to be addressed and could not wait for the 1.7 release. Thanks to the community for its quick work on turning around these fixes!</p>
