We're excited to join one of the largest PhoneGap user communities again in [Barcelona on Wednesday, February 24](http://adobephonegapbarcelona.phonegapspain.com/) during Mobile World Congress.

This year we're partnering with 4YFN (4 Years From Now), the home of the fast-growing tech startup community, to host our second PhoneGap Spain meetup. Join us for on-stage presentations from the PhoneGap team and other PhoneGap experts. And what would a PhoneGap meetup be without beer?! Stay tuned after the event for a networking pub mixer.

Here's a quick look at what we have lined up:

- [Simon MacDonald](https://twitter.com/macdonst), Senior Software Engineer - Adobe PhoneGap, will talk about how and when to use push notifications on mobile platforms. How to use them effectively and how not to annoy your users.

- [Claudio Cossio](https://twitter.com/ccossio), Labs - Nearsoft Inc, will discuss the evolution in the interaction of software, apps and interconnected devices (IoT). He'll talk about the main trends in user experience and high value interaction with the user.

- [José Jesús](https://twitter.com/JoseJ_PR), Adobe User Group Manager - PhoneGap Spain, will give tips for startups developing mobile apps.

If you're already headed to Mobile World Congress, your ticket includes entry to the 4YFN conference.
