We have flipped the switch to enable desktop browser support by default for
the `phonegap serve` command.

**Overview**

For the past 6 months, desktop browser support was available behind the flag
`phonegap serve --browser`. We kept the feature quiet, while we added browser
support to the core Apache Cordova plugins. We're now excited to turn this feature
on by default!

**Usage**

 Now when you run the command, the browser 
 platform is automatically added and served so that you can test and debug 
 issues directly from your desktop browser.

**Benefits of Desktop for Debugging**

This allows for a more seamless developement process, letting you continue 
to work within the browser using tools you are already familiar with. It 
also makes it possible to leverage the powerful debugging tools that are 
integarated in modern browsers.

**Plugin Support**

Currently all the core Apache Cordova plugins have browser support. Some have an actual implementation, while others simply return an error but continue running the application.

**Livereload**

Running your app in the browser also supports livereloading. Any changes that you make 
to your source code will be automatically pushed to the browser so that you can test it 
right away.

**Multiple Devices**

The addition of the browser does not affect the multi-device functionality that was 
already present when serving apps. Now you can run your app in the browser, as well as on 
an Android, iOS, or Windows Phone device all at the same time with livereloading.

Of course, using the browser may not be necessary for all users. 
If you would like to continue serving applications without the browser, you 
can do so by running `phonegap serve --no-browser`.

**Coming Soon**

We are currently working on bringing browser support to the Desktop App as well. Stay tuned for more details!
