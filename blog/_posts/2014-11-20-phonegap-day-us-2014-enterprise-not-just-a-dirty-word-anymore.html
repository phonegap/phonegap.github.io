<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>First up, we have <a href="https://twitter.com/brucelefebvre">Bruce Lefebvre</a>, Computer Scientist at Adobe, introducing the Adobe Experience Manager and PhoneGap integration.</p>

<p>Imagine being able to manage your application's lifecycle as well as understand how your app is performing from one single user interface? PhoneGap Enterprise gives you better insight into how users are getting through your app, where they're getting stuck, and what areas are getting overlooked. It also allows you to empower your content authors and other non-technical users to easily create and update app content over-the-air. Back and forth trips to the platform's app store are a thing of the past.</p>
