<p>Kudos to Voxeo Labs for today's launch of <strong>Phono Mobile</strong>. Phono Mobile integrates seamlessly with PhoneGap to add voice over Internet (VoIP) calling, IM and real-time messaging to any HTML5 application.</p>

<p>"Phono Mobile opens up the world of voice and chat communications to any mobile developer who knows how to use JavaScript and HTML5," said Jason Goecke, VP of Innovation for Voxeo Labs. "Developers can now create iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and Android apps that connect users directly using voice or chat."</p>

<p>Here at PhoneGap, we're looking forward to seeing how developers will enhance their mobile apps now that they can add audio and IM communication.</p>
