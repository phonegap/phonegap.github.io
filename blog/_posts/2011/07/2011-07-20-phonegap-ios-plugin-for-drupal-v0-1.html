<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>Jeff Linwood has started work on a PhoneGap iOS plugin for accessing the Drupal Services API. He has already done some amazing work on it and is looking for feedback. If you are interested in this check it out at on his <a href="http://www.jefflinwood.com/2011/07/announcing-phonegap-ios-plugin-for-drupal-v0-1/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+drupal%2Fxira+%28drupal+planet%29">blog</a>.</p>
