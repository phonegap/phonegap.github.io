<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.strobecorp.com/">Strobe</a> on its recent launch! Strobe is a new app platform and delivery  network that helps developers build HTML5-based Web applications for  desktops, smartphones and tablets, while centrally managing them from a  single interface. The best part? Strobe has <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap Build </a>integration  built in, which allows users to build for iOS, Android, BB, Symbian,  and webOS without having to download all the necessary SDK's and IDE's.</p>

<p>Some highlights from Strobe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a single interface from which to manage apps deployed to various devices</p></li>
<li><p>teams can easily manage code (both test code and production code)</p></li>
<li><p>developers can configure the app’s deployment across platforms (Web, Android, iOS, etc.), thanks to PhoneGap Build integration</p></li>
<li><p>you can add additional services (social, push notifications, authentication, etc.)</p></li>



<li><p>track analytics within an easy-to-use dashboard</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Besides PhoneGap, Strobe also utilizes SproutCore, an open source  JavaScript framework that allows developers to create web applications  with a user experience comparable to that of desktop applications. All  in all, this is good news for developers as Strobe's goal is to push a  single experience across multiple platforms and devices.</p>
