<p>Come join our PhoneGap meetup at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. on<em>* October 7 from 7-9pm</em>*. It's totally free!</p>

<p>This informal, fun meetup will feature an introduction to <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.  See a hands-on tutorial showing you how to use your HTML/JavaScript  skills to build applications for mobile platforms including iPhone,  Google Android, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm.</p>

<p>In the second half, you'll see a demo of PhoneGap for Windows Phone  7. Nitobi worked closely with Microsoft to bring PhoneGap to  WP7 devices and we opened up the beta in early September. <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/jesse/2011/09/08/pg-wp7mango/">Jesse MacFadyen</a>, Nitobi's Senior Developer, will give a rundown on how to get started and how it works.</p>

<p>If that wasn't enough, we'll be throwing in <strong>free pizza, beer and even some XBox 360 giveaways.</strong></p>
