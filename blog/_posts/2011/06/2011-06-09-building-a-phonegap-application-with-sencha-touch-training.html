<p>Hey Everyone, </p>

<p>On June 28, we will be having another online training event. This one will be focused on making a application from scratch using <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a> and PhoneGap. </p>

<p>Sencha Touch is a mobile JavaScript framework for developing HTML5 web apps that look and feel native. It is built with web standards in mind. Check out <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/app/ign-dominate/">IGN Dominate</a> to see an app made using Sencha Touch and PhoneGap.</p>

<p>If you are interested in attending this online training, please purchase one of the PhoneGap support subscriptions over at <a href="http://PhoneGap.com/services">http://PhoneGap.com/services</a>.</p>

-Steve</p>
