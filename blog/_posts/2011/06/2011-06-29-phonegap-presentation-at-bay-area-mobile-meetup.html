<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>On June 8th, 2011, Shazron Abdullah (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/shazron">@shazron</a>) and Jesse MacFadyen(<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/purplecabbage">@purplecabbage</a>) presented about PhoneGap Build and the PhoneGap ecosystem at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BayAreaMobile/">Bay Area Mobile Meetup</a>. </p>

<p>Representatives from PayPal also presented on the <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/iPhone/PayPalPlugin">PayPal plugin for PhoneGap iOS</a> which was created by Shazron. Some attendees at the event had also created an <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/PayPalPlugin">Android version of this plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Videos of these three talks have now been released. If you are interested in viewing them, please click on one of  the following links:

<p>The event had over 100 attendees.  It was sponsored by Samsung who also did a presentation on PhoneGap for Samsung Bada. Video for that presentation has not been made available yet.</p>
