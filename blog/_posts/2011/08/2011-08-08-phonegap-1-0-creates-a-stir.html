<p>We spend a lot of time watching the web, reading how developers work with PhoneGap and celebrating their apps. So, after last week's launch, we were pleased by the reception PhoneGap 1.0 received and the attention it got in the media. Here's a roundup of some of the tech publications that covered the release:</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/07/phonegap-1-0-launches-today.php">ReadWriteWeb</a>:
<em>"Most of the improvements to PhoneGap 1.0 came from its community of developers, which Nitobi CEO Andre Charland says is PhoneGap's "greatest asset."</em></p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Nitobi-Launches-PhoneGap-10-633395/">eWeek</a>:
_"PhoneGap 1.0 focuses on accessing native device APIs, which is new ground for the web. Other improvements include overall API stability and “pluggable” architecture, World Wide Consortium Device APIs and Policy (DAP) API compatibility, a contacts API and debugging tools."</p>
