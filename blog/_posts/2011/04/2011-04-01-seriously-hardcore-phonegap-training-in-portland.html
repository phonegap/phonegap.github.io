<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>We will be hosting a Seriously Hardcore PhoneGap Training in Portland on May 1, 2011!</p>

<p>In this unprecedented event, you'll get access to eight Nitobi hackers for a seriously hardcore dive into mobile web development.</p>

<p>The training day starts with basic PhoneGap concepts and rapidly moves into frameworks including XUI, Lawnchair, Jo, Sencha Touch and jQuery Mobile. We’ll also look at additional tooling like Sleight, Weinre, QUnit, DominatorJS and ThumbsJS. Finally, we’ll dedicate an entire afternoon to PhoneGap internals and plugin authoring for all the major platforms.</p>

<p>The material covered in this full-day, in-person workshop is all previously unreleased and much of it is at the undocumented edges of the PhoneGap platform.</p>

<p>If you want to learn absolutely everything you need to start building cross-platform mobile apps, this class will arm you with the knowledge, code and contacts you'll need to do it.</p>

<p>Here's the day's agenda:</p>

<p>10:30 - 12:00 - Intro to PhoneGap concepts and build chain
12:00 - 1:00 - Lunch and a beer
1:00 - 2:00 - iOS internals, plugin authoring
2:00 - 3:00 - Android internals, plugin authoring
3:00 - 3:30 - Coffee break
3:30 - 4:30 - BlackBerry internals plugin authoring
4:30 - 5:30 - Dark horses: webOS, Windows Phone 7</p>

<p>And Then, We Party
After training Nitobi will be hosting a party (with free beers, of course) at ApexBar. Check out the beer list: <a href="http://apexbar.com">http://apexbar.com</a>. It’s amazing.</p>
