<p>These past few weeks I've been working on porting the <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> framework to the <a href="http://developer.bada.com/apis/index.do">Samsung Bada</a> platform. </p>

<p>Bada ships with a default <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">Webkit</a> browser. It supports the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html">W3C geolocation</a> out of the box. The C++ SDK allows developers to instantiate a WebView (called Web Control in Bada) inside a Form (equivalent of a view in Bada). More info on Web control can be found <a href="http://developer.bada.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.osp.apireference.help/classOsp_1_1Web_1_1Controls_1_1Web.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>To port <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a>, I got most of my inspiration from the existing <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-iphone">iPhone implementation</a>. I use a similar technique on Bada. </p>

<h3>From Web to native</h3>

<p>`  </p>

<p>document.location = "gap://com.phonegap.com.Accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration"  </p>

<p>`</p>

<p>The url gets intercepted by the WebControl and the command is then dispatched to the appropriate module (Accelerometer module in the case above).</p>

<h3>From native to Web</h3>

<p>It does not seem to be possible to set the web control URL to "javascript:code" but there is a method that comes with WebControl that not only executes javascript code but also returns its result! The method is:</p>

<p>`  </p>

<p>Osp::Base::String *     EvaluateJavascriptN (const Osp::Base::String &amp;scriptCode) const  </p>

<p>`</p>

<p>That is really helpful for sharing data between Native/Web without overloading the URL with JSON/XML data!</p>

<p>The only downside is that it doesn't seem possible to stick an <em>alert();</em> as it causes the Web control to hang. I still haven't figured out a way to do this. So right now you can't use alerts in your phonegap callbacks. I am still investigating the issue.</p>

<p>PhoneGap Bada supports: <strong>Accelerometer, GeoLocation (Browser and Native), Contacts, Device, Network, Notifications, Storage (provided by WebKit), Events</strong>  </p>

<p>PhoneGap Bada does not yet support: Camera, File  </p>

<p>PhoneGap Bada won't support: Media</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of mobile-spec running on PhoneGap Bada.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://developer.bada.com">Bada SDK</a> is unfortunately Windows Only and there are no plans to port it to other platforms. However, you can run it just fine on a virtual machine.</p>

<p>Code and instructions are on <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-bada">github</a>. Check it out! Let me know what you think! Feedback good or bad is always welcome!</p>
