<p>You can now download PhoneGap 0.9.5. It was officially released today. Some of you are asking for release notes/change log. You can view the roadmap we followed on the <a href="http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/28291160/roadmap-planning">wiki</a>. I have also gone to each repo and pulled the commit logs between 0.9.4 -> 0.9.5. Here they are for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p><strong>iOS</strong>
Becky Gibson (11):
      fix ticket #79 and other file api cleanup
      name change from phonegap-(ver) to phonegap.(ver)
      Updates for different callback function types
      Update PhoneGap.exec mechanism to more closely match other platforms.
      Implementation of Directories and Systems File API
      Update JavaScript so PhoneGap modules are created only once, even if included multiple times.
      Implement readAsDataURL for iOS
      Updates to fileTransfer to conform to documenation
      Updated FileTransfer to return bytesWritten
      Remove files used in older implementation of contacts.
      fix ticket #122 - allow for lossy conversion when encoding data to write to file</p>

<p>Jesse (6):
      Added Javascript Callback shouldRotateToOrientation which is called before looking up supportedOrientations in the plist. shouldRotateToOrientation should return true or false depending on it's current state/preference. shouldRotateToOrientation is expected to exist in the global scope.
      Fixed setAutoresizingMask. It was accessed as a method when it is a property.
      Lifecycle events pause/resume
      Orientation issue : should always return YES for at least one orientation.
      Anchor tags with target="_blank" will correctly open in MobileSafari.     Targets of _self or _top will open in the app.     If target is NOT specified, it will open in the app.</p>

<p>Shazron Abdullah (3):
      Updated the FAQ for Xcode 4.
      Updated issue tracker link in README
      Updated the version to 0.9.5</p>

<p>ascorbic (1):
      Add FileTransfer</p>

<p>shazron (27):
      Updated FAQ
      Added i386 to VALID<em>ARCHS in PhoneGapLib project - so running in the Simulator on Xcode 4 works oob
      Updated FAQ for Xcode 4 error
      Fixed annoying grammar errors in FAQ
      Added helper text for xcode config file
      Updated PhoneGapLibTest project for new shell script
      Fixed typo in console.log (maxDepth)
      Crash fix: navigator.network.isReachable, when using the isIpAddress option.
      Fixed static analyzer warnings, set PhoneGapLib compiler to LLVM GCC 4.2
      Updated PhoneGap application template to handle PhoneGapLib and project locations with spaces in it. Fixes issue #130
      Updated Makefile for new phonegap.js filenames, and removed references to the iPad project template.
      Updated installer docs to to reflect latest changes.
      Updated FAQ item regarding issue #130
      Fixed incorrect usage of bzero.
      Shell script to create a PhoneGap project from the command line.
      Fixed create</em>project.sh to handle relative path to folder to put new project in.
      Modified PhoneGap app template project (added explicit SKIP<em>INSTALL=NO) and PhoneGapLib project (added explicit SKIP</em>INSTALL=YES). This is so "Build and Archive" will work properly under Xcode 4. This fix is for a bug that was fixed in Xcode 4.
      Fixed navigator.geolocation.watchPosition to only call the success callback when the position changes (not every single time).     Removed annoying NSLog.
      Re-fix for watchPosition: successCallback is only called in the first instance because navigator.geolocation.lastPosition will always be equal to the position passed in the callback (it would never have changed). Internal var to watchPosition is kept to keep track of the last position.</p>

<p><strong>Android</strong>
Bryce Curtis (9):
      Logging status from wrong object.
      Worked around JavaScript bridge exception for Android 2.3.  Use "prompt" instead of calling objects directly.  There were several objects called from JavaScript, including BrowserKey, so key events had to be reworked.
      Ticket 106 - Simplify splash screen logic based upon idea from vadim.
      Add support for setting sms body using uri "sms:#?body=text".
      Bug 110 - When you close an app on Android you see a JS error in logcat.
      Add check to only init and run JS code once - even if included multiple times.
      Bug 126: NullPointerException in onDestroy()
      Ticket 136: window.openDatabase() in Android 3.0 throws SECURITY_ERR (most code written by Simon MacDonald - I just tested and checked in)
      Update version to 0.9.5</p>

<p>Fil Maj (16):
      Fix for ticket 86 (build fail if phonegap-android dir is located under a dir with "lib" in it). Also bug fix in build if config.xml didnt contain an (icon) element.
      Fix for build: version needs to be included in .jar and .js generated files.
      First pass at extracting icon width/height info and assigning to proper resolution dirs (i.e. ldpi, mdpi, hdpi) during build.
      Fix so that if not all icons are specified, doesnt error the build out.
      Use icon with no width/height if specified. Set default icon to highest-resolution icon when possible.
      Issue 107: Always send pause event to JS.
      Issue 107: always send resume event to JS.
      As best a fix as can be made for issue 95: on HTC devices, if text input is in bottom half of page, it does not get scrolled up to top half of page when you tap it and virtual keyboard comes up.
      Fix for lighthouse ticket 115: certain versions of Android 2.2 return "null" for window.openDatabase. Hook in PhoneGap fallback for storage in this case.
      Fix for ticket 121: Checking for null return on native openDatabase call not enough as only allowed one DB per PhoneGap app. Have to proxy openDatabase and check at runtime.
      Partial resolution for ticket 57: some issues with camera functionality not firing callbacks properly.</p>

<p>Jos Shepherd (1):
      Added native prompt() dialog support</p>

<p>Mark Darbyshire (1):
      Implement localStorage.key() and localStorage.length     This brings PhoneGap's implementation in line with the spec at http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/     It makes the following demo work when you include PhoneGap: http://people.w3.org/mike/localstorage.html     I was hopeful it would make my app, which makes use of LawnChair, work, but I've had no such luck as of yet.</p>

<p>Roman (1):
      Hidden NPE fixed, which appeared when someone pass null as arguments     (for such SQL as e.g. CREATE TABLE).</p>

<p>Vadim Voituk (1):
