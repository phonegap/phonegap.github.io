<p><a href="https://github.com/brycecurtis">Bryce Curtis</a> (aka PhoneGap super contributor) and Todd E. Kaplinger are giving a talk at the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">IBM Impact2011</a> conference this week. "TDD-1852A : Building Mobile Applications with PhoneGap"</p>

<p><strong>Here's the description:</strong></p>

<p>"With mobile applications, one of the first choices is which technology direction a developer should take. Developers may choose to develop native applications, or develop browser-based applications using HTML and CSS to give an appearance similar to native devices. With native applications, the programming model and languages are not common across all devices; with browser-based applications, you can't access all of the capabilities included on mobile devices. This is where PhoneGap comes in. PhoneGap is an open source development framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. Build apps in HTML and JavaScript and still take advantage of core features in iPhone/iPod touch, iPad, Google Android, Palm, Symbian and Blackberry SDKs."</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong>  </p>

<p>When:  Mon, 11/Apr, 05:15 PM - 06:30 PM  </p>

<p>Where:  Venetian - Marcello 4403</p>

<p>If you go please say hi and a big THANK YOU to Bryce from everyone at Nitobi and the PhoneGap team.</p>

<p>IBM's uber friendly website won't actually let me link to it. But if you go <a href="https://www-950.ibm.com/events/impact/sessions/search.do?method=loadSearchPage">here</a> and search 'phonegap' you'll find it no problem.</p>
