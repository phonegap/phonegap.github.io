<p>This past month my book on PhoneGap, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/PhoneGap-Beginners-Guide-Andrew-Lunny/dp/1849515360"><em>PhoneGap: Beginner's Guide</em></a>, or <em>PGBG</em>, was published by Packt Publishing.</p>

<p><em>PGBG</em> helps developers new to PhoneGap get up to speed with writing PhoneGap applications. The book focuses on practical examples, rather than reiterating the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com">PhoneGap documentation</a>, covering project structure and setup, HTML5/CSS3 techniques in modern mobile devices, and the PhoneGap APIs themselves. It should help you get PhoneGap apps up and running on all the major platforms.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to this blog and <a href="http://twitter.com/alunny">my twitter account</a> for more updates - I'm hoping to get a dedicated site for the book up soon, with references for each chapters and notes on any changes to the PhoneGap APIs since publication.</p>
