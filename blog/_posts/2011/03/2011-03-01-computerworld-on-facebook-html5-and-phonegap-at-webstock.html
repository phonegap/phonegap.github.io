<p>Just caught this <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/newmedia/webstock-praise-from-international-presenters#FF7B9FB4A422BE27CC2578460004FB98">ComputerWorld article</a> on New Zealand's famous <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/">WebStock</a> conference. Looks like one of the themes this year was HTML5 and cross platform development. Although no one from Nitobi from the PhoneGap team was there to speak it looks like Facebook's open source guru <a href="http://davidrecordon.com/">David Recordon</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/daveman692">@daveman692</a>) gave PhoneGap and <a href="http://build.phonegap.com">PhoneGap Build</a> a nice little plug in his presentation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fortunately, development environments are evolving to ease multiple builds. Facebook’s David Recordon, in a presentation centered on HTML5, spoke of PhoneGap, a service for developers to “write your app using HTML, CSS or JavaScript, upload it to the PhoneGap Build service and get back app-store ready apps for Apple iOS, Google Android, Palm, Symbian, BlackBerry and more”."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Dave! Feels nice to get a mention from person and company who's clearly kicking ass in the mobile space!</p>

<p>I did just want to clear up that the name PhoneGap has nothing to the clothing chain. As was maybe implied by "The name alludes to the economical-products-for-everyone approach of the Gap clothing chain." We're trying to bridge the gap between native and web technologies that's all:)</p>

<p>Hopefully I can head down to New Zealand and WebStock next year!</p>
