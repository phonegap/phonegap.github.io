<p>I'm speaking at CTIA as part of the of the <a href="http://www.mobilewebandappsevent.com/agenda.html">Mobile Web and Apps event</a>.  I'm going to be giving a quick overview of HTML5 and the open web community and trying to make the case for folks to build their dev stack on top top of it. That's the short version…here's the long winded conference abstract version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mobile apps are a must-have for any Fortune 500, Internet start-up or enterprising hacker. That being said these developers all have different interests needs. It's important to help them all but it's important understand what they're looking for.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how can you add mobile to your mix and build out an app ecosystem in an effortless, economical way? By using the most flexible, open and cost-effective technologies available -- HTML5 and open source.  </p>

<p>There's a lot more to HTM5 than a spec from W3C there's a growing movement of HTML and JavaScripts developers working on building a better mobile world for users. We just have to enable them.  </p>

<p>In this session, open source pundit and PhoneGap creator Andre Charland will demonstrate how building apps using open standards and open source produces better apps at a lower cost than native development. You'll learn how HTML5 can be combined with free development frameworks and tools to build fully functional,  </p>

<p>platform-neutral apps that are future-proofed for what's to come in  </p>

<p>phones, tablets and beyond.</p>

<p>My talk is at 3:20pm but there's a tonne of interesting presentations and panels before and after. Come on by and hang out.</p>

<p>If you know of any other PhoneGap talks please let me know. The best is probably twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/andrecharland">@andrecharland</a>. Failing that just come find me at SeaWorld!</p>
