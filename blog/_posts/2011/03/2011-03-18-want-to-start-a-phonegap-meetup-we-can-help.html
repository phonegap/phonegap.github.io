<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>We’re stoked by the self-starter attitude in the PhoneGap community. With PhoneGap Meetups popping up here and there, we figured a mini PhoneGap Meetup organizer kit would be a useful tool. So, here’s everything you need to start a PhoneGap Meetup in your town. A meetup is a great way to connect with other PhoneGap fans and developers in your neighborhood, brush up on your app skills, trouble shoot your projects and brainstorm ideas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-SF/">Check out</a> what the members of the San Francisco PhoneGap Meetup have to say about their community.</p>

<p>Ways We Can Help</p>

<p>Nitobi can help kick start your meetup in three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>We'll sponsor your meetup listing on <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> for the first year (US $144)</li>
<li>We'll buy the first round of beers at your first event.</li>
<li>Use our ready-to-go online presentations that may help spark discussion at your meetup.</li>
</ol>

<p>How else can we help?</p>
