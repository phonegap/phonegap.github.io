<p>Our friends over at Eclipse Foundation launched the OrionHub beta program yesterday. OrionHub is a hosted implementation of Orion, a new Eclipse project to define a platform for building and  integrating web development tools. An early release of Orion includes an editor for JavaScript, HTML and CSS that runs in  popular browsers and has the ability to easily link with popular web-based  tools.</p>

<p>The OrionHub hosted service is open to the first 5000 developers who sign-up at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/orion">http://www.eclipse.org/orion</a>. Check it out.</p>
