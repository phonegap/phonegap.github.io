<p>Yesterday, we <a href="http://phonegap.com/2011/12/19/phonegap-1-3-released/">announced</a> the release of PhoneGap 1.3.0. This early holiday present included many improvements, new features and bug fixes across many platforms. </p>

<p>One of the most exciting parts of PhoneGap 1.3 is the full support of Windows Phone, including the full PhoneGap API and Windows Phone Getting Started Guide. Developers can also enjoy a selection of PhoneGap plug-ins that support social networks - including Facebook, LinkedIn, Windows Live and Twitter - and a solid integration into Visual Studio Express for Windows Phone.</p>

<p>"Building apps for Windows Phone requires the use of Visual Studio, and early on we chose to use C# as the development language for all native functionality," said Jesse MacFadyen, one of PhoneGap's core developers and main lead on bringing PhoneGap to Windows Phone. "Visual Studio is a very capable tool and the out of the box templates it gives you to make a Windows Phone app are very well documented, easy to understand, and a great help in getting started."  </p>
