<p>Hey Everyone,</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.rnao.org/">RNAO</a> was the top paid medical iPhone app in iTunes Canada. RNAO stands for the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario. The app was made using PhoneGap by <a href="http://nitobi.com">Nitobi</a>. It delivers professional development programs and also publishes the "Nursing Best Practice Guidelines".  If you want to download the app on either iTunes/Android/BB check out <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/app/rnao-nursing-best-practice-guideli/">http://www.phonegap.com/app/rnao-nursing-best-practice-guideli/</a>.</p>

<p>Also, check out the case study about RNAO on the Nitobi website at <a href="http://nitobi.com/casestudies/rnao/">http://nitobi.com/casestudies/rnao/</a>
