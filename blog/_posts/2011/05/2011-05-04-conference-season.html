<p>The Nitobi office right now is starting to empty out, and it's not just because of the weather.  It's conference season and the other guys are at JSConf.  However, I'm going to be going to some conferences this year.  I'm going to be going down to the SF area Google IO this year.  Feel free to ask me about PhoneGap and PhoneGap Android when I'm down there.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18969">I'm speaking at OSCON this year</a> and if you follow this blog's details about working on WebKit, it's going to be more of the same, except with better slides, more detail and MUCH, MUCH more hunting for weird comments in WebKit.</p>

<p>I'll probably be attending other conferences related to PhoneGap and Android Development at some point this year, but those are the ones that are confirmed.  If I find out about any more, I'll definitely be postng them here.</p>
