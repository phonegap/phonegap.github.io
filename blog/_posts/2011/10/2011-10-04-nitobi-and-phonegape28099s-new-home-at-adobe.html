<p>This is a very exciting time in the industry and for our team. However, it's also a time of great change which is often met with skepticism and possibly some fear. Let's get to the point: PhoneGap and all the code that makes it awesome is staying free and open source. Maybe more so than ever with our contribution to the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<p>I feel the team at Nitobi and the rest of the of our contributors did a great job getting PhoneGap to where it is today. We shipped 1.0 this summer and have been making great progress since, in fact we just shipped PhoneGap 1.1 last week. It's time to step on the gas and accelerate development of the platform, both from our team (now Adobe:)) and the wider community, which is why we're putting PhoneGap in the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<p>The issue of cross-platform app development is just now hitting mainstream attention and PhoneGap will come under increasing competitive threats. We think building on an open platform is essential to ensuring the web wins, and under Apache we can collaborate with all those who share this vision. No doubt we will compete with others and now we can do so with the support of Adobe, another company firmly committed to the web and cross platform tools and solutions.</p>

<p>We've built Nitobi on a bootstrap. We've built other great products over the years but now we're on to something bigger and bolder. It's really a movement around building apps and services with web technologies that run everywhere. We now need to focus our whole team on PhoneGap, PhoneGap Build and other tooling around HTML5 and JS development. The web and technologies that support it need fostering and support in an open manner. I'm excited to work on that!</p>

<p>We're also launching PhoneGap Build with the help of a team that's been building something awesome—cloud tools and infrastructure on top of Amazon Web Services. We're committed to pushing forward with more cloud-based tooling and services that will help developers. We announced PhoneGap Build is in open beta last week and we're getting ready to roll out for full on prime-time commercial use soon. We'll be adding features and fixing bugs every day as usual. We'll be honouring all existing client projects, support and training. We may be finding other partners and solutions to help deliver those services that are vital to the eco-system. Otherwise, it's business as usual!</p>

<p>The whole team is moving to Adobe and this was very important to me. Some of us will move to SF to have more influence in the Adobe mothership and some of us will stay in Vancouver to continue to grow and foster the culture around the PhoneGap project that's made it so great. I'm going to SF which is a great opportunity but I'll miss the Vancouver office Kegerator. It's really still just the beginning for PhoneGap and our team. The Nitobi team is amazing and they are some of the most talented, smart, creative, loyal and funny group of people I've ever worked with. I'm looking forward to continuing our journey together. </p>

<p>At Adobe, we will be able to focus and work together more closely than ever without the constraints and distractions you have when running a small business. I'm also excited to be joining some of the smartest minds in the industry at Adobe. Their contributions to open source and the web have largely flown under the radar. Adobe has 2 contributors to the WebKit project and have played a key role in the jQuery Mobile project. Now you tell me that WebKit + jQuery + PhoneGap don't make up the most killer trio in the mobile we and app space. If you doubt Adobe’s intentions, it's important to consider how Adobe makes money—it's from tools, services and solutions not shipping runtimes.</p>

<p>Oh ya and given that I'm moving to California…I'll probably learn how to surf too;-)</p>
