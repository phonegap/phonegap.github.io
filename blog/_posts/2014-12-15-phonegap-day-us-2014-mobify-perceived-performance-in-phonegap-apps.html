<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day US. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Our next session comes from the incredible <a href="http://www.mobify.com/">Mobify</a> team.</p>

<p>Making users believe your app is fast is just as important as actual speed. Your users don’t care about the metrics behind performance — they care about how fast it feels. In this workshop we'll cover the history of perceived performance, how you can measure it and provide practical skills for improving how fast your application feels. Some of the strategies we'll cover include providing instant feedback, seamless feeling loading animations, taking advantage of the GPU and familiar physics for gestures as well as pre-emptive loading performance hacks.</p>
