Last week, we quietly released the PhoneGap CLI 6.0.0!

## Install or Update

You can install the latest version by running:

```javascript
$ npm install -g phonegap
```

Please checkout the [PhoneGap Docs](http://docs.phonegap.com/) for [detailed OS X and Windows installation guides](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/phonegap-cli/install/).

## Template Support

The main highlight of PhoneGap 6.0.0 is template support in Apache Cordova. PhoneGap has had template support for nearly a year and we're happy to see it land inside Cordova as a default feature.

**Using a template**

When creating a new app, you can use an app template other than _Hello World_.

The following will create an app using our [Framework 7](http://framework7.io/) template ([view on Github](github.com/phonegap/phonegap-template-framework7)):

```bash
$ phonegap create my-app --template framework7
```

When you use a template, it is fetched fresh from npm, so you'll always use the latest release.

**Listing available templates**

PhoneGap comes bundled with a set of templates to get you started:

```bash
$ phonegap template list
blank              A blank and empty PhoneGap app.
hello-world        Default hello world app for PhoneGap.
framework7         Starter PhoneGap project for Framework7.
react-hot-loader   Starter PhoneGap project using React.js, Babel, Webpack and Hot Reloading.
```

**Searching for more templates**

You can also install templates authored by others from npm. At the moment, only the PhoneGap Team has published templates, but we're hopeful that others will get on board. You can [find available template on npm by searching for the `cordova:template` keyword](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=cordova%3Atemplate).

For example, you can install the [Framework7 template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phonegap-template-framework7) using the npm package name:

```bash
$ phonegap create my-app --template phonegap-template-framework7
```

**Learn more about templates**

You can learn more about using templates by running the following two help commands:

```bash
$ phonegap template --help
$ phonegap create --help
```

## Additional Changes

Some additional highlights includes:

- default Android platform is `cordova-android@5.1.0`
- default iOS platform is `cordova-ios@4.0.0`
- default Windows platform is `windows@4.3.0`
- deprecation notice for Amazon FireOS
- deprecation notice for Windows Phone 8
- added `--no-hooks` option
- plugins are now fetched from npm instead of plugins.cordova.io

You can read the full release notes on the [Cordova 6.0.0 Release blog post](http://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/01/28/tools-release.html).
