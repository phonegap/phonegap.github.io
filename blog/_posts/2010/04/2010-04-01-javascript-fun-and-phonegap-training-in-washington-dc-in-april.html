<p>As the calendar flips over to April, we're stoked about some of the things Nitobi is up to this month. For starters, we'll be at <a href="http://jsconf.us/2010/">JSConf</a> in Washington DC from April 17-18, 2010. If you haven't been to JSConf you're missing out on one of the best JavaScript programming events of the year. It's sold out this year-likely because the theme is pirates-but be sure to put it on your calendar for 2011.</p>

<p>While we're at JSConf, we'll be connecting with the good people of Washington DC for a <a href="http://mobileappdevtraining6.eventbrite.com/">PhoneGap training session</a>. We've been having a great time spreading the PhoneGap love across North America and we hope you'll join us for this full-day workshop on April 16, 2010. You'll learn how to build mobile applications in HTML and JavaScript while still taking advantage of core features of the Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Symbian and Palm. </p>
