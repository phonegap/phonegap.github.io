<p>Recently, a blog post came forward from <a href="http://divineprogrammer.blogspot.com/">Mikael Kindbord</a> about running Rhino on Android.  I was then asked to take a look at it,and it was pretty interesting.  He recently released a project called <a href="http://github.com/divineprog/droidscript">DroidScript</a>, which is actually really interesting.  It's an interesting front-end to Rhino, and it has the Javascript using Dalvik Android classes with Javascript so that you can have intents and invoke any method in Javascript that you can in Java.  It does produce some pretty verbose code, and while I'm not going to re-structure Android PhoneGap so that it uses this just yet, it's an interesting thought experiment in how many different ways you can write code for Android.</p>

<p>If you're interested in Android and Javascript, I high recommend checking it out.</p>
