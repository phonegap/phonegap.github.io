<p>We were stoked to see PhoneGap included in today's Mashable's piece, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/08/11/cross-platform-mobile-development-tools/">5 Cross-Platform Mobile Development Tools You Should Try</a>. </p>

<p>Writer Jolie O'Dell urges readers to check out PhoneGap and some other tools  as an "excellent alternative to ignoring one mobile OS in favor of another, or perhaps worse, burning serious resources to develop for two or three platforms at once."</p>

<p>The article also gives a nod to <a href="http://rhomobile.com/">RhoMobile</a>, <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Appcelerator</a>, <a href="http://widgetpad.com/">WidgetPad</a> and <a href="http://www.mosync.com/">MoSync</a>.</p>

<p>Even cooler than PhoneGap getting a thumbs-up from Mashable is seeing growing attention and support for cross-platform development.</p>
