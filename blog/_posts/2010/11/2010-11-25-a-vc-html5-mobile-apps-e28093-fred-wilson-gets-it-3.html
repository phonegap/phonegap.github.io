<p>Fred Wilson a very well respected investor just came to a realization about HTML5 apps that is going to send fan boys screaming!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I saw two HTML5 apps yesterday. One running in my Android browser. The other running in the iPad browser. They looked and worked exactly like their mobile app counterparts. It was a mind opening moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>via <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/html5-mobile-apps.html">A VC: HTML5 Mobile Apps</a>. So how much money is Fred going to be putting in companies building multiple native apps per platform? This is going to be more an more the case as HTML/JS technologies evolve and devices get faster. Fred's not even talking about PhoneGap apps which could give you even more features that makes you HTML5 equal to a native app, yet cross platform. Although a large number of technologists have understand this for a long time it's nice to see non tech focused folks starting to realize that HTML5 can be on par with native apps…so don't through your money away!</p>

<p>For insights from Fred I'd have a look at the recent interview from Fred at O'reilly's Web 2.0 Summit. Fred calls it like he sees it and doesn't get wrapped up in hype that other folks in the echo chamber might.</p>

<p>FYI. Fred's an investor in Twitter, Foursquare, Tumblr and <a href="http://www.unionsquareventures.com/investments/index.php">others</a> you may have heard of via Union Square Ventures.</p>
