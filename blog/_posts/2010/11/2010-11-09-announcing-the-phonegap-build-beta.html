<p>We're pleased to announce the launch of <a href="http://build.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap Build</a>. You can visit the site to sign up for the beta--we're distributing them in handfuls each week. Here are the details via our launch announcement:</p>

<p>Nitobi Inc., the creators of the PhoneGap mobile application development framework, today announces the beta release of PhoneGap Build (http://build.phonegap.com). The new service makes it easy to deploy mobile applications across multiple platforms, including Google Android, Palm, Symbian, BlackBerry and more.</p>

<p>PhoneGap Build takes the pain out of building mobile apps for multiple platforms by compiling mobile applications in the cloud, eliminating the need for SDKs, compilers and hardware. Developers simply write apps using ubiquitous Web technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, upload their apps to PhoneGap Build, and get back applications for a variety of platforms. PhoneGap Build supports Google Android, Palm, Symbian and BlackBerry with support for iOS, Windows Mobile and others coming soon.</p>

<p>“With PhoneGap Build developers can write HTML, JavaScript and CSS, compile it in our cloud and run it natively on any mobile platform,” said Andre Charland, Nitobi CEO. “It’s a continuation of our work with PhoneGap and demonstrates our dedication to providing Web developers with a way to build mobile apps using open standards and technologies they already know and love.”</p>

<p>“Smart software development shops are using the cloud for test and deployment, avoiding on-premise hardware and configuration hassles,” said James Governor, analyst and co-founder, at Redmonk. “PhoneGap Build now takes the same approach with Nitobi’s open source compilation framework for turning standards-based web apps into native phone apps ready for app stores.”</p>

<p>PhoneGap Build is an extension of PhoneGap.com. Since winning the Web 2.0 Expo LaunchPad competition in 2009, PhoneGap has been widely recognized as a game-changer for mobile app development. The open source code has been downloaded more than 350,000 times and thousands of apps built using PhoneGap are available in app stores and directories.</p>

<p>To sign up for the PhoneGap Build Beta program, visit http://build.phonegap.com. Nitobi will invite new beta users each week until general release. PhoneGap Build is free during the beta period and will remain free for open source projects.</p>
