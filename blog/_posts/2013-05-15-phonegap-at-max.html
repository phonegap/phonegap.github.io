<p>The PhoneGap team headed to LA from May 4-8 to attend <a href="http://max.adobe.com">Adobe MAX</a>. We were stoked to have so many PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build sessions there! We met tons of people who were new to PhoneGap and lots who were already familiar with us and wanted to take it to the next level. </p>

<p>Did you know? The Adobe MAX mobile companion app was made with PhoneGap! Even though the conference is now over, you can still check out the <a href="http://max.adobe.com/community/mobile-apps.html">app</a> and see how it works. </p>

<p>If you weren't able to attend MAX, we have a video round-up of most of the sessions that were presented:</p>
