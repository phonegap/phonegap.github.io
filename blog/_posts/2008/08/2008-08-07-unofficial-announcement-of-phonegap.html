<p>Flying back to Vancouver after attending the iPhone Dev Camp in San Francisco. With me was Rob Ellis and Andre Charland. We went down with one goal in mind and that was to make native iphone features available to web apps. To say we are pleased with our results is a huge understatement. We have managed to take care of all the Objective-C for you to empower you to build native-like web apps using purely web technologies.</p>

<p>PhoneGap</p>

<p>What we have done is embedded webkit into a native Objective-C application and built a javascript API that calls the native iphone functions such as geo location and accelerometer. You now really can write rich iphone applications without writing a single line of Objective-C.</p>

<p>iPhone Dev Camp</p>

<p>Adobe did a fantastic job, Hosting a dev camp of top form and the developers at the camp came through in a big way. A huge thanks goes to Eric who wrote most of the Objective-C for PhoneGap and Rockstar Brad for pitching in when we had some technical projects. Open source works people. This weekend proves it and that is why PhoneGap is released under the MITÂ license. <a href="http://github.com/sintaxi/phonegap/tree/master">You can get the source here.</a></p>
