<p>I just received word from Apple that :</p>

<p>a) Apple has given PhoneGap a technical analysis , and PhoneGap does not violate the Terms &amp; Conditions of the App Store.  </p>

<p>b) Apple will review PhoneGap applications based on their own merits and not on their use of PhoneGap.</p>

<p>What this means:</p>

<p>There was still some apprehension within the community as to whether or not using PhoneGap would lead to a possible rejection from the iPhone App Store, we definitely have a green light to PhoneGap.  This means we can all get back to doing what we love best, building fast, easy mobile apps with JavaScript+HTML+CSS while still taking advantage of the core features in the iPhone, Android, Symbian-WRT and Blackberry devices.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
