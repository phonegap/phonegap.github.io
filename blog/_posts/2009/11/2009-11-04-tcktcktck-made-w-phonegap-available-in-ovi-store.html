<p>The <a href="http://tcktcktck.org">Tcktcktck</a> mobile application is now <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/7768D145DCED51E1E040050A85324FB8">published and available in Nokia's Ovi Store</a> to a selection of several S60 5th Edition devices. I believe it was recently approved in Blackberry's app world, so once the iTunes Store sorts itself out, we'll have a bit of a success story using PhoneGap for cross-platform mobdev!</p>

<p>PS the canucks are winning with half their forward lineup, plus luongo, injured. Bieksa even played forward last night haha! they're makin a run.</p>
