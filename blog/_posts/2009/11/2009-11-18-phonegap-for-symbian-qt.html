<p>During the initial stages of working on <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> for <a href="http://www.symbian.org/">Symbian</a> using <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Technology_Topics/Web_Technologies/Web_Runtime/">Web Runtime</a>, some limitations were brought to light due to the fact that Nokia's WRT is closed source: we are limited to the device functionality and platform support which Nokia has exposed. Nonetheless its a great technology and porting PhoneGap to WRT was a relatively quick win (taking in to account my having to re-learn javascript after 1 year of flailing abroad).</p>

<p>But over the last few weeks, while maintaining the latter, I've been researching/experimenting (don't even want to go far as say developing, as very little has been implemented) with <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/developer/qt-4.6-rc-for-symbian-developers">Qt for Symbian</a>. The crew at Nokia just released the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/developer/qt-4.6-rc-for-symbian-developers">Qt 4.6 release candidate</a> on Nov 17th, and it includes a port of Webkit to Qt (QtWebkit), along with support for the Symbian/S60 platform, which is just the combination phonegap needs.</p>

<p>note my amazing javascript console, firebug is crap</p>

<p>So anyways I've got a PhoneGap Symbian Qt build (piggybacking off of the webkit demos included with Qt) which can open a local resource in a webview, and expose Qt Objects (and thus device functinoality) to javascript (via webframe->addtojavascriptwindowobject). I've implemented the most important API first, rather than the easiest: vibration. Ok it was actually the easiest.</p>

<p>Anyways there's other problems to tackle before implementation of more PhoneGap APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>XHRs seem to be getting blocked. I'm thinking its blocking what it considers a cross-domain XHR: a local html file to a remote server. I believe the support of this depends on the Webkit implementation(?)</p></li>
<li><p>I can't remember what else.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So if this looks interesting, help out the mobile developer community. Contribute. Its open source. Check out my very basic <a href="http://phonegap.pbworks.com/PhoneGap-Symbian-%28Qt%29">Getting Started doc</a>, and get the code from my <a href="http://github.com/wildabeast/phonegap/tree/symbian.qt">PhoneGap repo on Github (Symbian Qt branch)</a>. The .sis installer file is in there as well, so you could also just put it on your device to see a PhoneGap app that vibrates and thats about it. Really useful. I think you might need to install Qt libraries to your phone since I haven't packaged them in the app yet.</p>
