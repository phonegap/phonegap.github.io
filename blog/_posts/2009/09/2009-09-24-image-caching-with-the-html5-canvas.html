<p>Lately I have been working on an iPhone app ( using PhoneGap of course )  and needed to implement image caching on the client with javascript.</p>

<p>I am already using an SQLite database in mobile safari, so I decided I could store images in Base64 in the DB.  I was able to load the binary image data using XHR, but could not correctly encode it to base64 in javascript.</p>

<p>Exploring another path, I found that there is a method of the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/934012/get-image-data-in-javascript">HTML5 Canvas toDataURL();</a></p>

<p><strong>So I wrote this to download the image, instead of my XHR method :</strong></p>

<p>`  </p>

<p>ImageCacheManager.prototype.fetchImage = function(url)  </p>

<p>{  </p>

<p>var alias = this;  </p>

<p>var img = new Image();  </p>

<p>img.onload = function()  </p>

<p>{  </p>

<p>alias.onImageLoaded(this);  </p>

<p>};  </p>

<p>img.src = url;  </p>

<p>}  </p>

<p>`</p>

<p><strong>Then this to handle the loaded image and cache it :</strong></p>

<p>`  </p>

<p>ImageCacheManager.prototype.onImageLoaded = function(img)  </p>

<p>{  </p>

<p>var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");  </p>

<p>canvas.width = img.width;  </p>

<p>canvas.height = img.height;  </p>

<p>var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");  </p>

<p>ctx.drawImage(img,0,0);  </p>

<p>var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL();  </p>

<p>this.cacheImageData(img.src, dataURL);  </p>

<p>}  </p>

<p>`</p>

<p>To keep things short I have excluded the DB sections, I always check if I have an image cached already before I fetch one, and always write it to the DB when I do fetch.  If an image is retrieved from the DB it can simply be written to the img.src as is.  </p>

<p>I foresee all kinds of uses for this, like a javascript based image editor, or a water-marking script _ ( you can also draw text on the canvas before you pull out it's bits … ) _  </p>
