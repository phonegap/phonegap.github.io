<p>Integration with Overlay's services was somewhat easier. They have a published API but unfortunately for this project, it is intended for use on other websites, so it did not make sense in a client application.</p>

<p>Overlay also has a flash movie that they use in their pages to support viewing, creating and editing overlays. The flash movie is an AS2 movie, so I was not able to load it directly, but instead ended up creating an HTML control and dynamically modifying the flashvars to get at the functionality we needed. ( BTW I love the HTML control in Air! ) The Flash movie already implemented 100% of overlay's functionality, so I was very glad to be able to use it directly.</p>

<p>Working closely with Overlay, I was given instructions on how to authenticate a user and get xml back. Â For getting the list of the current user's overlays weÂ consumed just grabbed the user's rss feed.Â </p>

<p>So go check out the <a href="http://overlay.tv">Overlay.tv YouTube uploade</a>r and start making some overlays!. Â </p>

<p>Your feedback is welcomed.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
