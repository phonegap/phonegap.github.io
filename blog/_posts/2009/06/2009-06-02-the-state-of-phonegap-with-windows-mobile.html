title: The State of PhoneGap with Windows Mobile
type: post
format: html

<p>Well there is no state really, except for the proof of concept currently (by PhoneGap contributor Jose Noheda). I was re-factoring the PoC code, and getting everything working with the PhoneGap Javascript common code. In a nutshell, PhoneGap WinMo cannot use the existing PhoneGap js [1], as js support in the IE control in WinMo is too primitive. The current IE in WinMo is based on desktop IE 4 (released in 1997) and only supports JScript 3/Javascript 1.3.</p>

<p><strong>So where does this leave PhoneGap WinMo? These are the ways we can proceed:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Have a totally separate Js codebase, based on JScript 3, for WinMo. Con: Maintenance nightmare?</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade to IE Mobile 6. This discussion has its own section, below.</p></li>
<li><p>Use WebKit with Qt [5]. Pro: We can probably use Qt Webkit in Nokia phones (soon, not supported yet), because well, Nokia owns Qt. Con: Using Qt adds a 10MB overhead, minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Use our own WebKit control. Con: I don't know how long this effort will take, and it is the riskiest.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Internet Explorer Mobile 6</strong></p>

<p>IE Mobile 6 is based on desktop IE 6 (which was released in 2001) but with the IE 8 Javascript engine [2]. However, only newer (unreleased as of yet) phones will get this version, according to Microsoft [3]. Although there are development emulator images available, they are no substitute for testing on a device.</p>

<p>Even if we somehow get IE Mobile 6 on existing phones (with unofficial ROMs, eg through xda forums[6]), .NET code cannot take advantage of this, because Microsoft does not want to break existing compatibility with existing code that uses hosted controls [4].</p>
