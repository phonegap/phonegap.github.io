<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>We've been making some exciting progress with <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap </a>recently.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.nitobi.com/fil/bb/ec_ant.jpg" alt="The Ant Window in a PhoneGap BlackBerry project" /></p>

<p>The Ant Window in a PhoneGap BlackBerry project</p>

<p>First, the <a href="http://github.com/filmaj/mobile-spec">Mobile Spec</a> - our own homebrew set of tests for the PhoneGap API - is taking off. People are starting to watch it, fork it, and add to it. I am really stoked to see that - keep it coming!</p>

<p>Second, the PhoneGap team has been working on making developing and building PhoneGap applications easier. A big step towards this was putting together some build scripts so that you - the PhoneGap developer - did not have to go through the same, tedious steps to test and develop applications in your platform's IDE. <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron">Shazron</a> recently rolled out an installer for those iPhone PhoneGap developers out there and I saw it in action (as detailed in <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/shazron/2009/11/24/phonegap-mobile-spec-tests-on-iphone/">this</a> post) - it is hot shit. Super-easy! <a href="http://blogs.nitobi.com/joe">Joe</a> has the same thing going for Android, the Android.jar he put together is a huge step towards that. So, without further ado, I present to you: an <a href="http://github.com/filmaj/phonegap/commit/1868917a2c0e4bcaa75a8c24faf0ffb5ca8ffa11">Apache Ant build script for PhoneGap BlackBerry</a>! I've added it to the repository, as well as instructions in the readme on how to use it.</p>

<p>In my short time using it, the biggest win for me as a developer is the ability to build, sign and deploy to device with one command. It's super-fast too - <strong>way</strong> faster than using RIM's 'Desktop Manager' software to load the application onto the device.</p>

<p>If you've tried using it, post to the comments and tell me how it went! I'd be glad to help out, too, if you're having problems.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
