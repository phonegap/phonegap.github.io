Good news, you can finally hydrate your Windows Phone 8 apps on PhoneGap build!

Hydration will be particularly useful on the Windows Phone platform, as Windows Phone xap files can only be installed by using the Application Loader on a Windows machine, which is clearly a limitation of that platform. You'll still have to do this for your first install of the application (and anytime you change your config.xml and require a new binary install), but during development of your web assets (HTML, JS, CSS, etc) you'll be able to update quickly using Hydration.

We're continuing to seek ways to improve the Windows Phone Development cycle with PhoneGap Build -- we know its not ideal. Keep an eye on [this blog](http://phonegap.com/blog/phonegap-build) and our [twitter account](http://twitter.com/phonegapbuild) for more improvements.

And if you have any problems or questions, [don't hesitate to ask!](https://community.phonegap.com).
