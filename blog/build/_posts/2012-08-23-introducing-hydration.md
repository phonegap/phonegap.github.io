The PhoneGap Build team would like to introduce our latest feature -
Hydration.

So what exactly is it?

It's a tool that delivers updates directly to your device while also
significantly cutting down compile times during development.

<!-- end-slug -->

We accomplish this by compiling a native binary that acts as
a container for your mobile application.

Build uses heuristics to determine when a new binary needs to be
generated resulting in a shorter compile time, less fumbling with
downloads, easier versioning, and more time doing what actually
matters, developing and testing!

We hope that Hydration will add another dimension to your development
process and if you would like more information on Hydration have a look at our
[documentation](https://build.phonegap.com/docs/hydration).

If you have any questions or you would like to provide some feedback
to our team we use our [community support channel](http://community.phonegap.com)
for most of our communication. Don't hesitate to drop us a line!

<sub>* No devices were water damaged in the development of this feature.</sub>
