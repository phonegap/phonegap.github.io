**PhoneGap Intro**  
PhoneGap is a free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using the web technologies you're already familiar with: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use standardized web APIs and [target the platforms](http://phonegap.com/about/feature/) you care about. [Download](http://phonegap.com/download) PhoneGap for free right now and try it out.

The beauty of PhoneGap is that you’re able to reuse your existing web developer skills so you have a shorter learning curve and faster development. It’s based on 100% web standards and backed by large stakeholders like Google, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Intel, and more.

**What's the difference between PhoneGap and Cordova?**  
In October 2011, PhoneGap was donated to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under the name [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). Through the ASF, future PhoneGap development will ensure open stewardship of the project. It will remain free and open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

PhoneGap is an open source distribution of Cordova. You may see references to both PhoneGap and Cordova and their names used interchangeably. Think about Cordova's relationship to PhoneGap like WebKit's relationship to Safari or Chrome.
