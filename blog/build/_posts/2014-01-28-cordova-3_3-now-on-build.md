Now that our holiday shakes are finally gone, [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) can release Cordova 3.3.0! Here's more info on what's included:

 * [Adobe PhoneGap 3.3.0 blog post](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/12/13/phonegap-release/)
 * [Cordova iOS release notes](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md)
 * [Cordova Android release notes](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md)
 * [What's new in Cordova Windows Phone 8](http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2013/12/16/cordova-330.html#whats_new_in_windows_phone_7__8)
 
We're releasing Cordova 3.2.0 simultaneously (3.1.0 was our last release on Build), so any 3.2.0 updates will be noteworthy as well.

Sometime in the upcoming months, <b>we'll be deprecating Cordova 2.5.0 and 2.7.0</b>. Anyone building for Blackberry, WebOS, or Symbian will need to use 2.9.0. Otherwise, we highly encourage everyone to upgrade to 3.3.0 as soon as possible. If you have trouble upgrading, [please let us know](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi).

Also worth noting is with Cordova Android 3.3.0 comes support for Android 4.4.0 (KitKat), and specifically [remote webview debugging from Chrome browser on your desktop machine](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging). iOS already supports [remote debugging with Safari](http://moduscreate.com/enable-remote-web-inspector-in-ios-6/), and these solutions are much more stable than Weinre and [debug.phonegap.com](http://debug.phonegap.com). For Windows Phone 8, Weinre remains the only remote debugging option.
