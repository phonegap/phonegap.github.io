[PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) is happy to announce that we now support Cordova 3.1.0. For more info on what's included in 
this update, check out the [Cordova 3.1.0 release blog post](http://cordova.apache.org/blog/releases/2013/10/02/cordova-31.html).

You may have noticed that lately we've been deprecating older versions of Cordova with many of our releases. Thats not happening on 
this particular release, but we want to remind you to update your app to the latest version of Cordova as often as possible. Be aware 
that letting an app lie dormant on PhoneGap Build for too long will likely see its Cordova version become deprecated. The mobile 
development world evolves rapidly, and PhoneGap Build, and the applications created on it, need to evolve with it. 

As always, if you have problems uprgrading, or any other questions, [just ask](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi).
