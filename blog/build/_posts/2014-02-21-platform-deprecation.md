It’s been almost a year since PhoneGap announced they would be [dropping support](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/05/16/cordova-will-no-longer-support-bb/) for some platforms in versions of PhoneGap over 3.0. PhoneGap Build has [done the same](http://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/blackberry_symbian_and_webos_will_not_be_supported_by_phonegap_3_0) and is not supporting webOS, Symbian or Blackberry (<= BB7) for apps using PhoneGap versions over 3.0.

In addition, PhoneGap Build will be removing support for webOS, Symbian, Blackberry and Windows Phone 7 on the anniversary of PhoneGap 3.0 in July. For users that need to support those platforms they can still [download older versions of PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/install/).

We have heard from the community that newer platforms like Blackberry 10 and Windows Phone 8 are important to you, so in response we have included support for Windows Phone 8 and are looking into supporting Blackberry 10 as well as Firefox OS apps.
