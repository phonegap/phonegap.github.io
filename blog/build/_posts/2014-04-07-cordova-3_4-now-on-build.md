[PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com) has added Cordova 3.4.0! Here's more info on what's included:

 * [Adobe PhoneGap 3.4.0 blog post](http://phonegap.com/blog/2014/03/04/phonegap-3-4-release/)
 * [Cordova iOS release notes](https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/blob/3.4.0/RELEASENOTES.md)
 * [Cordova Android release notes](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/blob/3.4.0/RELEASENOTES.md)
 
Also, as a reminder, be aware that in July of this year we'll be [ending support for anything less than PhoneGap 3.0.0](http://phonegap.com/blog/2014/02/21/platform-deprecation/). This will include an end to support for Symbian, WebOS, and Blackberry.
