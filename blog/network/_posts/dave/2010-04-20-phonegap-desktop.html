	<p>So if PhoneGap was running on the desktop, what would you call it? Well I have not come up with a good name yet but after a few nights of hacking we threw together a version of PhoneGap for Mac OS<a href="http://github.com/shazron/phonegap-mac">http://github.com/shazron/phonegap-mac</a>&nbsp;and a version for Windows&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/davejohnson/phonegap-windows">http://github.com/davejohnson/phonegap-windows</a>.</p>
<p>@shazron has implemented the sound API on the Mac version and I did Geolocation on the Windows version using a simple GeoIP lookup.</p>
<p>Check it out, write some code, and let us know what you think!</p>
<p>For the Windows version I have used the awesome&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/webkitdotnet/webkitdotnet">WebKit .NET</a>&nbsp;project written by Peter Nelson. If you use the Visual Studio 2008 solution file, you will have to download the source or binary versions of WebKit .NET and setup the references correctly. I have so far used the 0.3 release of WebKit .NET. It is pretty cool being able to write a native Windows app (or Mac OS) in Canvas using all free and open source code :)</p>
<p>One other caveat on the Windows side is that you might need to install some Visual Studio C++ redistributables for building it &hellip; check the WebKit .NET forum on SourceForge for all the details.</p>
