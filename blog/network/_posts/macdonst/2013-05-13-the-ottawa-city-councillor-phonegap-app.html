Sadly, I didn't even know who my city councillor was until I started working on this app.<br /><br />It uses the <a href="http://data.ottawa.ca/en/">open data Ottawa</a> to get&nbsp;the city councillor information and it the <a href="http://opennorth.ca/">Open North API</a> to do reverse geocoding to turn your GPS co-ordinates into the correct ward.<br /><br />Currently&nbsp;the app is available on&nbsp;the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.occouncillor&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd">Google Play store</a> and we are going through the process of getting approval for the app on&nbsp;the Apple store.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> was&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;the way to go with this project. We developed pretty much in Android then when we were ready to release a version of the app we just compiled it in Xcode and it just worked. The only thing we changed were the break points for the CSS media queries to deal with the different iPhone screen sizes. Support for Windows 8 and BlackBerry 10 are also coming as we have time.<br /><br />I'm going to write up a post later in the week to talk about some of the micro libraries we used in order to accelerate development.<br /><br />Please give&nbsp;the app a try and let me know what you think of it and what can be done better. If you are so inclined we wouldn't mind a <a href="http://apps4ottawa.ca/en/apps/80">vote or two in the app in&nbsp;the Apps4Ottawa competition</a>.
