Shaz wrote up a <a href="https://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/whats-new-in-cordova-ios-2-3-0/">post on what's new in iOS</a> so I followed suit to do this one for Android. So without further ado here's what you should expect on Android:<br /><br /><b>1. InAppBrowser – includes events</b><br /><br />More details <a href="http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/inappbrowser-based-on-childbrowser-in-cordova-2-3-0/">here</a>. In a nutshell, this has the same functionality as the <a href="https://github.com/alunny/ChildBrowser">ChildBrowser</a>, and has events support as well. It supports this simplified spec. Also, the InAppBrowser does not use the app whitelist. Example usage: <script src="https://gist.github.com/4253717.js?file=inappbrowser.js"></script><br /><b>2. Device API changes</b><br /><br />Minor changes as specified here. For Android, device.name is now deprecated for all platforms.  For all platforms, there is a new property called device.model which returns what device.name used to return.<br /><br /><b>3. Various Bug Fixes</b><br /><ul><li>Searching for emails in Contacts throws an exception always errors out</li><li>Create script improvement: Display usage and exit when no arguments given</li><li>Fixed adding a Photo from a HTTPS address to Contact</li><li>Fixed NPE in onReceivedError with non local errorUrl</li><li>Camera.getPicture gives error when get a picture from photo library with spaces in its name on Android is now fixed</li><li>Online/Offline events now fire on subsequent pages of an app</li><li>fixing cordova commands for paths with spaces in them</li><li>FileEntry.moveTo across file systems incorrectly calls the success callback</li></ul><br /><div><ul></ul></div>
