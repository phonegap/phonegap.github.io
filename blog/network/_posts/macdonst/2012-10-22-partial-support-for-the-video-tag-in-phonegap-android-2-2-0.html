Well in the upcoming PhoneGap 2.2.0 we will have better, but not perfect, support for the video tag thanks to work by&nbsp;<a href="https://fr.twitter.com/steren">Steren Giannini</a>.<br /><br />In Android 4.x you only need to set the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/hardware-accel.html#controlling">hardwareAccelerated</a> attribute to true in order to get true in-line video tag support on Android.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in earlier versions of Android this doesn't fix the problem. So instead code has been added to&nbsp;the core of PhoneGap to detect the video tag and handle it better. Sadly, we are unable to play the video in-line but when a users taps on a video tag a full screen video player will be launched. In order to get back to the main app the user need only hit the back button to return to main app screen.<br /><br />There are a few caveats though. The video tag will only support a single source so it will need to look something like this:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;video poster="http://path.to.my/poster.png" controls&gt;<br />&lt;source src="http://path.to.my/video.mp4"&gt;<br />&lt;/source&gt; /&gt;<br />&lt;/video&gt;</blockquote>Additionally the source url can refer to a video on the internet using the http:// protocol or a local file using the file:// protocol. At this time videos in the assets directory are not support so something like file:///android_asset/www/video.mp4 will not work.<br /><br />So again, it's not perfect but it is better than nothing. If you are getting tripped up with one of the caveats I described above the VideoPlayer plugin still works.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/72386855013225666-4889999949695552571?l=simonmacdonald.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
