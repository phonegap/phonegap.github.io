So at PhoneGap Day US 2012 I talked about a side project I was working on to help make Cordova better by adding some extra UI bits. Since then a number of the pieces I was working on have been nominated to go into core so I will be revisiting my side project soon to bring it up to date. In&nbsp;the meantime have a good chuckle and don't be afraid to get involved in PhoneGap/Cordova development.<br /><br />
