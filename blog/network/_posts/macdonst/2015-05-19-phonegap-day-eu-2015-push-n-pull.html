It's one of my favourite days of the year. Besides getting to hang out with all of my co-workers who I rarely get to see in person as we are separated by half a continent I get to talk in person with the people who use our software.<br /><br />At PG Day I was presenting on the work that we've been doing in order to make the lives of developers easier. My presentation introduces the new and improved&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-push">Push Plugin</a>&nbsp;as well as the completely new <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-contentsync">Content Sync Plugin</a>. I'll be blogging more about these two new plugins in the up coming weeks but for now if anyone wants to check out the slides they are embedded below:<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="420" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="//slides.com/simonmacdonald/deck/embed" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="576"></iframe>
