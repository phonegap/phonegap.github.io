Boy, that's not the &nbsp;impression I get after helping people on the PhoneGap Google Group for the past week and a half.<br /><br />From what I understand most of us Cordova core developers use a Mac as our main machine. Now I don't want to and won't start an <a href="http://search.dilbert.com/comic/Holy%20Wars">OS holy war</a> since there is a very good reason why we do that, you can't do iOS without a Mac and the tools for Android and BlackBerry development will run on a Mac so it makes sense for those of us who have to jump back and forth to be using a Mac. However, we've really dropped the ball in explaining what the proper setup needs to be when you are on a PC.&nbsp;So that's why I'm writing this blog post from my old Windows laptop that I dusted off so I can feel your pain.<br /><br /><b>Required Software</b><br /><ol><li><a href="http://java.oracle.com/">Java Development Kit</a></li><li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a></li><li><a href="http://developer.android.com/">Android Development Kit</a></li></ol><div>Go ahead and download and install those packages if you haven't already. I'll wait. I'm not up to anything else right now. But please pay attention to where you install these packages as you'll need those paths later.<br /><br />Oh good, you're back.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>First problem</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Once you navigate to the phongeap\lib\android\bin directory the getting started guide tells you to run the following command:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">./create &lt;project_folder_path&gt; &lt;package_name&gt; &lt;project_name&gt;</blockquote>but that is not accurate on a Windows system as it won't be able to find the create command. The line should be: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">create &lt;project_folder_path&gt; &lt;package_name&gt; &lt;project_name&gt;</blockquote><b>Second problem</b><br /><br />Once you do that you probably will see this error:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VhnEJkakGMc/UKaVeIhk26I/AAAAAAAACKM/RKY-oiTYI5M/s1600/one.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VhnEJkakGMc/UKaVeIhk26I/AAAAAAAACKM/RKY-oiTYI5M/s1600/one.JPG" height="240" width="400" /></a></div><br />So basically and unhelpful error telling you that you are missing a package. We'll need to make sure the following commands can be run from the command prompt. Let's start by testing if the command line can find java.exe first. So type:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">java</blockquote>into the command line. If you see something like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-074SQJcodcw/UKaWZmRJLjI/AAAAAAAACKU/ANmeHMkYync/s1600/two.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-074SQJcodcw/UKaWZmRJLjI/AAAAAAAACKU/ANmeHMkYync/s1600/two.JPG" height="237" width="400" /></a></div><br />then you will need to modify your PATH environment variable so that the script can find Java. First you'll need to discover where your JDK is installed. I can't tell you where that is so I hope you took my advice and noted where the installer placed those files. Armed with the path to your Java Development Kit do the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>From the Desktop, right-click My Computer and click Properties.&nbsp;</li><li>Click Advanced System Settings link in the left column.&nbsp;</li><li>In the System Properties window click the Environment Variables button.&nbsp;</li><li>Select the PATH variable from the System variables section.&nbsp;</li><li>Select the Edit button.</li></ul><div>which means you should have a dialog something like this:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dk3M51byAKk/UKaYKGtc13I/AAAAAAAACKc/19gCVVhbsZA/s1600/three.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dk3M51byAKk/UKaYKGtc13I/AAAAAAAACKc/19gCVVhbsZA/s1600/three.JPG" height="400" width="358" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>This is where you will add the JDK\bin directory to your PATH. Notice you need to point to the bin directory where commands line java and javac are kept. For example "c:\jdk\bin". Also make sure to separate different path entries using a ";". Now you need to click OK then OK once more. After that close your command prompt and start a new one so the updated PATH variable will be used. In the new command prompt run:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">java</blockquote><div>once again and you should see something like this:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHYalTMDXAA/UKaY_78brpI/AAAAAAAACKk/ujxYMd-8ksI/s1600/four.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JHYalTMDXAA/UKaY_78brpI/AAAAAAAACKk/ujxYMd-8ksI/s1600/four.JPG" height="400" width="350" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Now the create script will be able to find java. Unfortunately you'll need to repeat the process for the following commands:</div><div><ul><li>javac</li><li>ant</li><li>adb</li><li>android</li></ul><div>If you get the <i>"blah" is not a recognized internal or external command</i> error message for any of the above you'll need to add it to the PATH.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, I hope that helps everyone. I'm going to make the error messages more descriptive while I'm on my PC for the&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;2.3.0 release.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/72386855013225666-103076099201115348?l=simonmacdonald.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
