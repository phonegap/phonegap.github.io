There isn't much to get excited about on Android in this release as it is mostly bug fixes. Check out the full list of commits in&nbsp;the <a href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/blob/2.5.0/changelog">CHANGELOG</a>. Fixes include:<br /><br /><ul><li>Fixing a null pointer exception when the user clicks the back button while the app is starting.</li><li>Enabling the application cache.</li><li>When going into the InAppBrowser then back to the main application you could get a corruption of your WebSQL DB.</li><li>New configuration parameter "disallowOverscroll" to remove that blue glow when you try to scroll past the top/bottom of the screen.</li><li>Enabled geolocation in the InAppBrowser.</li></ul><br />However, something I can get excited about is that in the past month we've seen 8 new committers to the Android project. Yup, 8 new coders contributed their time to cordova-android which I think is a great sign of the health of the project.
