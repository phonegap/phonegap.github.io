Back in September of 2012 I posted up my sample app called Anna which highlighted the power of doing speech recognition on mobile devices using <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>. Today I've had to pull the app from the Play Store because of this infringement notice from Wolfram Alpha.<br /><br /><iframe height="480" src="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByqXCfBbb7_OZjBBMFh6Rm5yczcxeEswZzNSNDdHamhhWWFN/preview" width="640"></iframe> <br /><br />I don't have the strength, time nor money to fight this so I just going to rolled over pulled the app. I attempted to discuss it with Wolfram Alpha but they insisted I 1) pay for an commercial deployment license, 2) remove the Wolfram Alpha functionality or 3) pull the app. I can't afford the rates they charge for a commercial deployment license. Still they can't do anything about the source code for the app which is still available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/macdonst/anna">https://github.com/macdonst/anna</a><br /><br />I'm not even mad, just a bit puzzled as there is no way my sample app is in any way a threat to the Wolfram Alpha app in the Play Store. I guess they don't want to have a precedent where they don't aggressively enforce their terms of service.<br /><br />It's rather silly as I don't even ship an API key with the app. If you want to use Anna you have to sign up with Wolfram Alpha so they won't be getting the, albeit small, exposure that my app provides. Also, I doubt I'll ever recommend them to any of my developer friends ever again.
