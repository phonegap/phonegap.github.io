Over the holidays I came across this nifty new open source framework called Ionic that I was intrigued by and wanted to share with others. Ionic is currently in alpha state, but it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out. It was created by the guys who are responsible for some other successful projects including Jetstrap and Codiqa [&#8230;]
