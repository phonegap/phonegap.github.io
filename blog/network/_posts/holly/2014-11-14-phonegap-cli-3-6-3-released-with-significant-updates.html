The PhoneGap CLI has undergone some significant changes recently to realign better with Cordova and a new version 3.6.3 has just been released. These changes will help to alleviate previous deviations between the two. Some of these updates are behind the scenes and will not necessarily be apparent to developers but will allow new features [&#8230;]
