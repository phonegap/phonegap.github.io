One of my blog readers (thanks Fede!) notified me of a new push notification service that integrates with PhoneGap called Puship. I wanted to write a quick post about it to make others aware. You can use this service to send push notifications for Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry. They are currently in beta [&#8230;]
