I&#8217;m working on a simple application that acts &#8211; a bit &#8211; like a sound board. You select an item, click a button, and you hear an MP3. While letting one of my kids play with it, they quickly discovered that if they hit the button multiple times in a row, the sound would play [&#8230;]
