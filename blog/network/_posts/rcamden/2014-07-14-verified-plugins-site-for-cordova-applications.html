<p>
Currently the main site I use for finding Cordova plugins is <a href="http://plugins.cordova.io">plugins.cordova.io</a>. Last week Telerik announced the creation of a new site, the <a href="http://plugins.telerik.com/">Verified Plugins Marketplace</a>. This site contains plugins that have been tested to ensure they work well and contain sample apps written with <a href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui">Kendo UI</a>. I've often said that as a new Node developer, the availability of npm modules is both good <i>and</i> overwhelming as well. Having a curated, filtered list of plugins could be a huge benefit for Cordova/PhoneGap developers.
