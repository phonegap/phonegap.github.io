<p>
Thank you to everyone (especially the PhoneGap team!) who showed up to the open session that <a href="http://devgirl.org/">Holly</a> and I ran today. We had a great size crowd and a very interesting set of questions. Between Holly and I and other PhoneGap members we were able to cover nearly everything. The pace picked up towards the end but we had a firm cut off time so we couldn't go long. We definitely plan on repeating this soon. I'm using Gists for the logs. First is the Q and A log:

And here is the chat log. This is a bit more free form but there are some good nuggets in here as well.
