Over the holiday weekend Cordova 3.5.0 was released. You can read details about the update here: <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2014/05/23/cordova-350.html">Apache Cordova 3.5.0</a>. Another update was to the documentation, which now includes a <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_next_index.md.html#Next%20Steps">What's Next</a> guide that talks about what Cordova developers should learn, think about it, bookmark for future reference <i>after</i> they've learned the basics. I think this is an important piece of documentation and I'm happy to see it finally published. (Oh, and may be a bit biased as I wrote the first draft. ;)

Also released is a new <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_appdev_security_index.md.html#Security%20Guide">Security Guide</a> for Cordova developers. Definitely check this out as well.
