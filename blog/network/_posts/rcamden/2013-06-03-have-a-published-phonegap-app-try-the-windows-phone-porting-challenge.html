Simply port your application and test it in the Windows Phone Emulator and then publish it to the Windows Phone Store by June 30th, 2013. Prizes for winners include Surface Pros and Windows devices. To be clear, those of you with Macs (like myself) can test with VMFusion. I have and have had success seeing my content show up on my Windows Phone device. To help you get started, here's an introductory video on PhoneGap and Windows Phone.

Note - even if you haven't published a PhoneGap application to an app store yet, you can do so and then submit your app to Microsoft!<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RaymondCamdensColdfusionBlog/~4/prORf0ztCdk" height="1" width="1"/>
