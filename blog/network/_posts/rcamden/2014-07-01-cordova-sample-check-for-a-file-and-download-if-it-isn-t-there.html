I've begun work on trying to answer the <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/6/23/PhoneGapCordova-File-System-questions">questions I gathered</a> concerning Cordova's FileSystem support. As I work through the questions I'm trying to build "real" samples to go along with the text. My first sample is a simple one, but I think it is pretty relevant for the types of things folks may do with Cordova and the file system - checking to see if a file exists locally and if not - fetching it.
</p><p>
I'll begin by sharing the code and then explaining the parts. Here is the entire JavaScript file for the application.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">document.addEventListener(&quot;deviceready&quot;, init, false);

&#x2F;&#x2F;Will be a directory entry object for our data store
var storeOb;

&#x2F;&#x2F;Used for status updates
var $status;

&#x2F;&#x2F;URL of our asset
var assetURL = &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;cfjedimaster&#x2F;Cordova-Examples&#x2F;master&#x2F;readme.md&quot;;

&#x2F;&#x2F;File name of our important data file we didn&#x27;t ship with the app
var fileName = &quot;data.txt&quot;;

function init() {
	
	$status = document.querySelector(&quot;#status&quot;);

	$status.innerHTML = &quot;Checking for data file.&quot;;

	&#x2F;&#x2F;The directory to store data
	var store = cordova.file.dataDirectory;

	&#x2F;&#x2F;The Object version - no error handler because this must work
	window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(store, function(ob) {

		storeOb = ob;

		&#x2F;&#x2F;Let&#x27;s check the directory to see if our file exists
		storeOb.getFile(fileName, {create:false}, function(f) {
			console.log(&#x27;yes, the file existed&#x27;);
			appStart();
		}, function(e) {
			console.log(&#x27;file did not exist&#x27;);
			$status.innerHTML = &quot;We need to download the file.&quot;;
			downloadAsset();
		});


	});

}

function downloadAsset() {
	var fileTransfer = new FileTransfer();
	console.log(&quot;About to start transfer&quot;);
	console.log(&quot;dest: &quot;+storeOb.fullPath + fileName);
	console.log(&quot;dest: &quot;+storeOb.toURL() + fileName);
	fileTransfer.download(assetURL, storeOb.toURL() + fileName, 
		function(entry) {
			console.log(&quot;Success!&quot;);
			appStart();
		}, 
		function(err) {
			console.log(&quot;Error&quot;);
			console.dir(err);
		});
}

&#x2F;&#x2F;I&#x27;m only called when the file exists or has been downloaded.
function appStart() {
	$status.innerHTML = &quot;App ready!&quot;;
}</code></pre>

<p>
Ok, let's break it down. The first step is to check to see if our file exists already. The question is - where should we store the file? If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file/blob/master/doc/index.md">docs for the FileSystem</a>, you will see that the latest version of the plugin adds some useful aliases for common folders. Unfortunately, the docs are not exactly clear about how some of these aliases work. I asked for help (both on the PhoneGap Google group and the Cordova development list) and got some good responses from Kerri Shotts and Julio Sanchez. 
</p>

<p>
The directory that I thought made sense, cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory, is incorrectly documented as being writeable in iOS. A pull request has already been filed to fix this mistake. For my application, the most appropriate directory is the next one, cordova.file.dataDirectory. Once I have my directory alias, I can transform it into a DirectoryEntry object. This then lets me use the getFile API to see if the file exists. 
</p>

<p>
If the file does not exist, we then have to download it. For this we use a second plugin,  <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file-transfer/blob/master/doc/index.md">FileTransfer</a>. This is where one more confusion comes in. We need to convert that DirectoryEntry object earlier, the one we used to get an API for files and directories, back to a URL so we can give a path to the Download API. 
</p>

<p>
So to recap - we've got a few moving parts here. We've got a directory alias, built into the plugin for easily finding common folders for our application. Again, the docs here are currently a bit wrong but they should be corrected soon. We can use that alias to get access to the directory and check for files. We can also use the directory to get a proper URL (local file URL) to use with FileTransfer calls.

Simple... but even a simple application caused me a bit of trouble, so hopefully this helps other.
