title: New Salesforce Mobile SDK 2.3 with Cordova 3.5 Support
---
The Salesforce Mobile SDK allows developers to easily build Native (iOS and Android) and Hybrid (Cordova-based) applications on top of the Salesforce platform. Version 2.3 was released last week, and you can find the list of new and improved features in the official announcement blog post. My own favorite new feature is Cordova 3.5 support [&#8230;]
